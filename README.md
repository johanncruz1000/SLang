# S Programming Language

SLang is a **compiled programming language** designed to combine
**clean syntax**, **high predictability**, and **native C++ performance**
— without **boilerplate**.

- No `int main()`
- Optional semicolons
- No wrappers

---

## Why SLang?

Most languages force you to choose:
- simplicity **or** performance
- scripting **or** system-level power
- safety **or** control

SLang refuses that trade-off.

## Basic Features

- Compiled language
- Native C++ code injection (anytime, anywhere)
- Predictable behavior (explicit types, explicit blocks)
- No `int main()` required
- Optional semicolons
- Import system
- Script-like syntax with system-level power

---

## Philosophy

SLang **trusts the programmer**.

It does not try to protect you from yourself.
It gives you full control — and expects you to know what you're doing.

If you want safety rails, this language is not for you.

## Hello World

```slang
print("hello world!")
```

## Status

- Stable. Minimal by design.
